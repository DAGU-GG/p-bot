# Modern UI Region and Livestream Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Time Module Import Issue in Capture Loop**
   - Fixed "cannot access local variable 'time'" error by properly importing the time module within the capture_loop method

2. **Missing Method in CardRecognizer**
   - Added `recognize_single_card` method which is required for the hole cards and community cards recognition

3. **Unicode Emoji Logging Errors**
   - Replaced emoji characters like âœ… with plain text alternatives like [SUCCESS] to avoid Unicode encoding errors in the Windows console

4. **Region Loading and Application**
   - Fixed region loading mechanism to ensure regions are properly applied to both CardRecognizer and CommunityCardDetector components
   - Added proper error handling for cases when regions aren't found

## Debugging Tips

If you encounter issues with card recognition:

1. **Verify Region Configuration**
   - Make sure the `regions/region_config.json` file exists
   - Use the "Refresh Regions" button in the UI to manually reload regions
   - Check the logs for successful region loading messages

2. **Test Card Recognition**
   - Use the "Test" button to capture a single screenshot and verify that regions are correctly positioned
   - Look at debug images in the `screenshots` or `debug_images` folder

3. **Unicode Encoding Issues**
   - If you see Unicode errors in the logs, it indicates that emoji characters in log messages are causing issues
   - This is fixed now by using plain text alternatives

4. **Verifying Livestream**
   - The livestream should now update at a faster rate than the analysis
   - The "Start Bot" button should now correctly initiate the livestream
   - The bot should still perform card analysis at regular intervals

## How to Use the Fixed System

1. Launch the app with `python src/modern_ui.py`
2. Click "Find Table" to locate the poker table
3. Click "Refresh Regions" to ensure latest region configuration is loaded
4. Click "Test" to verify that regions are correct
5. Click "Start Bot" to begin livestreaming and analysis

If you still experience issues, run the test script:
```
python test_region_loading.py
```

This will verify that regions are properly loaded and accessible to all components.
