# Region Loading and Livestream Fixes

## Problems Found:

1. **Region Loading Issue**: Regions were properly loaded in the MainWindow class but not fully applied to the card recognizer and community card detector components. The references were updated but the internal state wasn't properly refreshed.

2. **Livestream Not Working**: The capture loop had ineffective timing logic which prevented continuous updates. The livestream was trying to perform full analysis on every frame which caused lag and unresponsiveness.

3. **Debug Card Recognition**: The `_process_and_display` method in `debug_card_recognition.py` didn't properly handle cases where regions weren't loaded.

## Implemented Fixes:

1. **Fixed Region Loading**:
   - Enhanced `initialize_bot()` to properly call `update_regions()` methods when available
   - Added a `refresh_regions()` method to force reload regions at any time
   - Added a "Refresh Regions" button to the control panel
   - Implemented better verification and error handling for region loading

2. **Improved Livestream Functionality**:
   - Separated display updates from analysis to maintain smooth video stream
   - Reduced the minimum capture interval for more responsiveness
   - Implemented a separate livestream display update with higher frequency
   - Maintained last successful analysis for continuous display
   - Added better error handling to prevent freezes during analysis

3. **Debugging Improvements**:
   - Added verification in debug_card_recognition.py to check for regions
   - Created comprehensive test script to verify region loading and integration
   - Added better error messages and visual feedback for missing regions

## How to Use:

1. **Start the Modern UI** with:
   ```
   python src/modern_ui.py
   ```

2. **Find a Table** using the "Find Table" button to select a PokerStars window.

3. **Refresh Regions** using the new "Refresh Regions" button if regions were calibrated/edited after starting the UI.

4. **Test Capture** to verify that regions are working correctly with the "Test" button.

5. **Start Bot** to begin continuous livestream with periodic card analysis.

## Troubleshooting:

If card recognition still doesn't work:

1. **Check Region Configuration**: Make sure that `regions/region_config.json` exists and contains valid region data.
   Run the `test_region_loading.py` script to verify proper loading.

2. **Manual Region Reload**: Use the "Refresh Regions" button after making any changes to region configuration.

3. **Verify Screenshots**: Check the debug screenshots in the `screenshots` folder to make sure the capture is working.

4. **Recalibrate Regions**: If necessary, recalibrate the regions to match your specific table layout.

## Advanced Testing:

The new test script `test_region_loading.py` verifies that regions are:
1. Properly loaded from the configuration file
2. Correctly formatted for each component
3. Successfully integrated with both CardRecognizer and CommunityCardDetector

Run it to diagnose region loading problems:

```
python test_region_loading.py
```
